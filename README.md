# VGG Face descriptor with OpenCV DNN
![img](https://i.imgur.com/v4c2heJ.png)
This demo shows how to use [VGG Face](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/) pre-trained model recognize face in one picture, and recognize multi face with [Haar Cascades](https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html).

## File tree
* Data\ -all test images and others(model too large can't put on gitgub)
* Program.cs - one face detection
* MultiFace.cs - multiple face detection

## Result
